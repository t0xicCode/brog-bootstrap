brog-bootstrap
==============

Brings the wonderful world of bootstrap (v3) to brog

INSTALL
-------

For a new install, extract the archive, and run `brog init` in the directory. It'll recognize the files and not overwrite them.

For an existing install, it is recommended that you use merging software (e.g. meld or winmerge) to merge your existing assets and templates with the bootstrap ones. As always, when making changes to templates, you'll have to restart brog for the changes to appear.
